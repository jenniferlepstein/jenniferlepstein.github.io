                    <p>I am a freshwater ecologist, geospatial scientist, and water quality advocate who combines data and policy analysis to untangle 
                        complex problems and achieve insights to help fix them. I am driven by an insatiable curiosity about the world and an unquenchable 
                        desire to improve systems.</p>
                    <p>I am particularly interested in the ways that stormwater, wastewater, and drinking water systems in towns and small cities intersect
                        with streams, rivers, and wetlands in the environment. I do work that helps people to understand their local systems, so that they 
                        can make informed decisions about how their communities should develop and operate.</p>
                    <p>A native of New York's Hudson Valley, I currently live in Arusha, Tanzania, with my husband and two kids. When I am not working, you 
                        can find me planning family adventures to the mountains or the water, researching my family genealogy, or reading science fiction.</p>

                <p>"The Threat of Landfill Leachate to Drinking Water in Hudson/Mohawk Rivers" is a project that I co-founded to examine the interconnections between solid waste 
                    landfills and drinking water in the Hudson and Mohawk Watersheds. We have documented how and where approximately 91 million gallons of landfill leachate are 
                    diluted and discharged into the Mohawk River and Hudson River Estuary every year. In late 2024 we will release a report, web map, and StoryMap that explain 
                    the regulatory loopholes behind this practice and map its impacts in our project area.</p>

                    water stress threatens an increasing number of places. The river basin that I live in is one example, and I used my Masterâ€™s 
                    Degree in GIS Capstone project as an opportunity to study it. My general goals for this final project were to focus on remote 
                    sensing data, modeling, and open-source tools. I explored the potential for an empirical model using only remote sensing data 
                    to estimate river flow. My model did reasonably well, showing that the concept has potential as a tool for water management.</p>

                <p>River dams cause a wide range of negative impacts to flowing waters, and dam removal is an increasingly popular ecological restoration method. 
                    Due to the cost and complexity of removals, and the sheer number of dams present in the landscape, it is useful to prioritize dams for removal. 
                    I created a spatial model to prioritize dams in the Hudson River Estuary watershed for removal based on potential to restore habitat access.

                <p>The Clean Water Act is a 50-year-old U.S. law that was created to ensure that all waters are 'fishable, swimmable, and drinkable.' This infographic 
                    highlights the gaps between how the CWA was designed to work, and where it often breaks down. The CWA focuses on what state governments must do, but 
                    it also calls for extensive public involvement. One of the overarching solutions to these breakdowns, I believe, is to open more doors, more widely, 
                    to community involvement.</p>

                <p>I worked with a volunteer watershed alliance to complete a comprehensive water quality assessment designed to provide the type of data that New York State 
                    grant and technical assistance programs require. The ultimate goal of the project was to help municipalities access water quality improvement project 
                    funding. I also developed an action agenda to suggest future work guided by the data.</p>

                <p>Learning about other cultures and viewpoints has always been important to me. I served as a Peace Corps Volunteer in Cape Verde and Benin, working with 
                    local schools and women's business cooperatives. My personal blog is a record of my experiences and thoughts.</p>
