                    <p>I am a freshwater ecologist, geospatial scientist, and water quality advocate who combines data and policy analysis to untangle 
                        complex problems and achieve insights to help fix them. I am driven by an insatiable curiosity about the world and an unquenchable 
                        desire to improve systems.</p>
                    <p>I am particularly interested in stormwater and wastewater infrastructure in towns and small cities, and in ways to restore aquatic 
                        ecosystems in these places while reconnecting people with nature.</p>
                    <p>A New York State native, I currently live in Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia, with my husband and two kids. When I am not working, 
                        you can find me planning family mountain or water adventures or reading science fiction.</p>

                <p>River dams cause a wide range of negative impacts to flowing waters and the species that rely on them. Dam removal is an increasingly popular ecological 
                    restoration method. Due to the cost and complexity of dam removal projects, and the sheer number of dams present in the landscape, it is useful to 
                    prioritize barriers for removal. I created a suitability model to prioritize dams in the Hudon River Estuary watershed for removal based on potential 
                    to restore anadromous or resident fish habitat access. The model was validated using results from a similar published model and the results differed 
                    substantially, potentially highlighting the importance of input data.</p>

                <p>Wastewater infrastructure is essential for preventing water pollution, but in the U.S., much of it is well past its intended lifespan. In 
                    New York State's Hudson Valley, investment needs are staggeringly large when aggregated at the state or regional level. To help residents 
                    connect local water quality problems to local solutions, I created a spatial database of project costs at legislative and watershed scales.</p>

                <p>The Clean Water Act is a 50-year-old U.S. law that was created to ensure that all waters are 'fishable, swimmable, and drinkable.' This infographic 
                    highlights the gaps between how the CWA was designed to work, and where it often breaks down. The CWA focuses on what state governments must do, but 
                    it also calls for extensive public involvement. One of the overarching solutions to these breakdowns, I believe, is to open more doors, more widely, 
                    to community involvement.</p>

                <p>Hydroelectric power is renewable and therefore often assumed to be 'green,' but dams fundamentally alter the character of free-flowing rivers. These  
                    modifications are one of the reasons that freshwater biodiversity is collapsing. The once-in-a-generation federal license renewals for two Mohawk River 
                    dams were opportunities to improve wildlife and water quality protections.<br></p>
